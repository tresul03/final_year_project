src: contains scripts written for the purpose of experimentation throughout this project.
semester1: contains notebooks from semester 1:
    Weeks 2-3:
        Start with initial model architecture.
        See if we can obtain a reliably accurate and precise model with an extremely small dataset.
        Begin testing the effect of iteratively retraining the model on its accuracy and precision.

    Week 4:
        Test the effect of model cost against epochs.
        Test the effect of iteratively retraining a model based on regions of greatest residuals on model performance.

    Week 5:
        Investigate the effect of dropout probabilities on training the model.
        Test the effect of iteratively retraining a model based on regions of greatest standard deviation on model performance.
        Investigate a model with a multidimensional input and output.

    Week 6:
        Compare Resul's proposed model with Stijn's.
        Implement normalisation into the model.

    Week 8:
        Train the model on SKIRT data.

    Week 9:
        Same as week 8, but with differing model architecture. This is where the code for the current model is stored.

semester2: contains notebooks from semester 2.
